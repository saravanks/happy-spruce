It is an initiative by a team of mental health professionals working for Sarwin Counseling. Bts is a forum to discuss about the various forms of stigma which people are experiencing in different walks of life. Blog readers would have an opportunity to be aware of the stigma associated with mental health, which would help them and the people around them to lead a positive and holistic life.

# **Health**

What comes to our mind when we hear that word? Most likely physiological health. Well, it is quite an important aspect of our lives, but there is also mental health. Both change consistently throughout our lives. Like our physical bodies, our minds can also become unwell.

Mental Health problems may actually be more common than you think. One in four of us will be affected by mental illness in a year. The effects of these problems are as real as a broken arm or any other ailment even though there isn’t a sling or plaster cast to show for it.

The metaphor (one in four) would mean that it might probably be your family members, friends or even colleagues who are dealing with a mental health problem.

Race/class/caste/status/age has nothing to do with mental health problems.

Any day money alone cannot bring happiness into a person’s life, though it plays a vital role in a person’s economic development. It is health, be it physical or mental which brings about a positive and holistic development. Economic development and health should go hand in hand.

When you are emotionally low, it generates negative feelings and would lead to being unproductive at workplace which would negatively impact an individual’s home environment. The actual problem starts here as you might want to detach yourself from the people around you be it your family or friends or even colleagues.

Please do not succumb to this misperception; 

That by isolating yourself or being wild, would bring you to back to normalcy. Rather approach your well wisher or a family member. This can reduce half your burden. 

If you still feel emotionally low you need a counselor’s help. 

Remember approaching a counselor is NOT shameful; neither does it mean that you have a problem. We are not here to label you, just help. 

Now there arises a question within you. 

“Can I help?” 

How can I help my friend or family member/ colleague? 

Approach us  

What is “LIFE” according to SARWIN COUNSELING? 

LIFE= Live It Fight Evil 

As a friend/family member/ colleague we have the responsibility to help them fight Stigma attached to mental health and lead a positive life. 

**A few tips** 

Start helping people around and make them feel secure, which would help them break their stigma and come out of their shell by breaking paradigms and absolving prejudices. Help them live their life to the fullest. We all have a part to play in making things in life easier for people around. 

If you find your friend/family member/colleague emotionally low or depressed, do ask him/her how are you doing? 

Too many people are made to feel isolated, ashamed and worthless as a result of their mental health issues. 

Give him / her a comfortable feeling that they can open up to you /or ask them how they are feeling once in a while.
